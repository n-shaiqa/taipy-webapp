# Front-end source code

This directory contains the source code for the front-end parts of Taipy GUI and Taipy.

- `./taipy-gui`: The source files for building the front-end part of Taipy GUI.<br/>
  This includes the web application used by Taipy GUI to expose user interfaces as
  well as all the visual elements, implemented in React.
- `./taipy`: The source files for building the front-end part of Taipy.<br/>

Note that before the `taipy` part is built, the `taipy-gui` part must have been built.
